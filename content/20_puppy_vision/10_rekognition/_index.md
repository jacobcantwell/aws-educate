To understand more about what Amazon Rekognition can do, let’s try the out-of-the box demonstrations. Let’s try a celebrity challenge first.

1. To begin, type *Amazon Rekognition* in the AWS Management Console search bar.
```bash
Amazon Rekognition
```
![AWS Management Console search bar](10_rekognition/images/rekognition-01.jpg "AWS Management Console search bar")
You are now on the Amazon Rekognition homepage. Amazon Rekognition can detect specific people, celebrities and even objects from photos you upload.

2. On the left-hand side of the page, choose **Celebrity Recognition**.

On the Celebrity Recognition page, you will find this picture of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. If you look to the right, you can see that AWS Rekgonition has identified that the person in the photo is Jeff Bezos with 100% confidence.

3. Choose the **Upload** button.
4. Upload a photo of a famous celebrity and see if Rekognition can recognise them.

Fantastic! How amazing is the Cloud? After today, you will know how to create you very own model that can detect whatever you want in a photo.
