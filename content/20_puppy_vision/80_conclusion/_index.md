## Conclusion

### Removing the demo application

To remove the demo application, open the AWS CloudFormation Console, click the **CustomLabelsDemo** project then right-click and select "*Delete Stack*". Your stack will take some time to be deleted. You can track its progress in the "*Events*" tab. Once the stack deletion is complete, the status will change from "*DELETE_IN_PROGRESS*" to "*DELETE_COMPLETE*". It will then disappear from the list.
### Thank you
