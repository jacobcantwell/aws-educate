## Creating the project

Letâ€™s get started on the Puppy Challenge journey!

To create the project, we need to complete the following steps on the AWS Management Console. The AWS Management Console is where we can access all of our services such as Lex, which is used to power our AI assistant Alexa. Think of the console as the homepage of AWS.

The buttons which you need to press are circled in *red*. If you get lost, please ask your teacher or raise your hand on the Zoom chat!

1. To begin the Puppy Challenge, type *Amazon Rekognition* in the AWS Management Console search bar.
