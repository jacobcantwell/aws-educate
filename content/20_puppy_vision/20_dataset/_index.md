## Creating the dataset

To train our program to detect puppies, we need to create a dataset first. A dataset is collection of data which is needed to train the cloud to detect puppies in photos.

It is like learning at school; in order to remember a fact you need to repeat it.

Go and find the following photos of puppies on the internet.

* 5 photos of puppies by themselves
* 5 photos of puppies at the beach
* 5 photos of puppies with people

1. To create the data set click on **Create data set**
2. Select *Upload pictures from your computer*
3. Choose **Add images**
4. Drag your chosen photos into the box to upload them
