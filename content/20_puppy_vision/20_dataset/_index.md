## Creating the dataset

This is the part of the challenge where we use Amazon Rekognition to train our computers to detect puppies. To do this we need to first create a dataset.

For us, the dataset will be a collection of puppy photos that Amazon Rekognition will learn from in order to detect puppies in photos.

To train Amazon Rekognition how to detect puppies, we need to give it a set of puppy photos first so it can learn what they look like.

You have ten minutes to find the following photos of puppies on the internet. Search the free stock photos [Pexels website](https://www.pexels.com/search/puppy) to find some photos of puppies.

* Five cute photos of golden puppies
* Five photos of puppies at the beach
* Five funny photos of puppies

Make sure to save all pictures to your desktop.

1. We need to start by creating the data set. Choose **Create dataset** to begin.

2. Like when you have a puppy, it is also important to name our data set. Type in *PuppyPhoto* (no space) into the data set name box.

3. We need to upload the pictures you found earlier to the data set! Choose *Upload images from your computer*.

4. To add photos into the dataset, you can either drag your photos from the desktop into the data set or click *Choose files* and select your puppy photos from the desktop.

In the next step, we will start labelling our photos.
