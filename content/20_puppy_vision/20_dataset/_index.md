## Creating the dataset

This is the part of the challenge where we use Amazon Rekognition to train our computers to detect puppies. To do this we need to create a data-set first.

For us, the data-set will be the collection of puppy photos that AWS Rekognition will learn from in order to detect puppies in photos.

To train Amazon Rekognition how to detect puppies, we need to give it a set of puppy photos first so it can learn what they look like.

You have ten minutes to find the following photos of puppies on the internet. Search the [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/puppy) image website to find some images of puppies.

* 5 cute photos of golden puppies
* 5 photos of puppies at the beach
* 5 funny photos of puppies

Make sure to save all pictures to your desktop.

1. We need to start by creating the data set. Choose **Create dataset** to begin.
