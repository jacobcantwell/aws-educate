## Training the model

After you label your images, youâ€™re ready to train your model.

Training a model is how Amazon Rekognition can learn to detect puppies in photos based on your dataset. As with humans, computers take a while to learn as well!

As part of model training, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels requires a labeled test dataset. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels uses a test dataset to verify how well your trained model predicts the correct labels and generate evaluation metrics. Images in the test dataset are not used to train your model and should represent the same types of images you will use your model to analyze.

1. Choose **Projects**.
2. Choose your project **PuppyChallenge**
3. Choose **Train new model**.

4. For *Choose project*, choose your **PuppyChallenge** project.
5. For *Choose training dataset*, choose your **Puppies** dataset.
6. For *Create test set*, choose **Split training dataset**.

With a *Split training dataset*, Amazon Rekognition will hold back 20% of the images for testing and use the remaining 80% of the images to train the model.
