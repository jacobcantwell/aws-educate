You are ready to get started on the *Puppy Challenge*!

To complete the challenges, we need to complete the following steps on the AWS Management Console. The AWS Management Console is where we can access all of our services such as Lex, which is used to power our AI assistant Alexa. Think of the console as the homepage of AWS.
