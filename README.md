# AWS Educate Workshops

## Puppy and Kitten Vision AWS Educate Workshop

### The Puppy Challenge

The Puppy Challenge is a fun, innovative workshop that teaches you the basics of machine learning on AWS. The goal of this workshop is to build a program that can recognize a puppy in a photo. We will be using AWS services including Amazon Rekognition which lets you identify objects and scenes in images.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is learning how to perform a task from a collection of examples. Machine learning is all around us and powers tools that we use everyday like Amazon Alexa, language translation, movie recommendations, and driverless cars.

Today we are going to learn how to make your own machine learning program so that in the future you can help build amazing technologies that will help change the world.

### Workshop Goals

* Create your own machine learning model which can detect puppies in photos
* Learn about the basic skills needed for machine learning
* Understand how machine learning and the cloud can be used in the future
